Creating and manipulating databases with MongoDB is a good example of one way that a different technology can be used.
3. My work on this type of project would help a company because it allows for the manipulation and aggregation of data. And allows the user to do this via a UI making it more intuitive. Computer Scientists performs duties like this but on a bigger and much more complex scale. They utilize technology in conjunction with analytical skills in order to solve problems and for innovation.
